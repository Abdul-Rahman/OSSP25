/*
Explanation
We added a semaphore maxDiners, initialized to 4, which ensures that at most four philosophers can eat simultaneously.
Before picking up chopsticks, a philosopher must acquire maxDiners.
After eating, the philosopher releases maxDiners so another philosopher can eat.

NOTE: The loop is infinite because each philosopher runs inside a while (1) loop 
in the philosopher function. This means they will continuously go through the cycle 
of thinking, picking up chopsticks, eating, and putting them down without ever stopping.
Since the program never exits naturally, the main function never reaches the semaphore 
destruction part. To stop the program, you would need to manually terminate it 
(e.g., using Ctrl+C).
