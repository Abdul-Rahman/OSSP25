/*
Explanation
1. Synchronization Mechanism:
rw_mutex: Ensures only one writer writes at a time.
mutex: Protects read_count updates.
read_count: Tracks the number of active readers.

2. Reader Execution:
When a reader starts, it locks mutex, increments read_count, and if it's the first reader, it locks rw_mutex (blocks writers).
The reader reads the shared data.
When it finishes, it decrements read_count. If it's the last reader, it unlocks rw_mutex.

3. Writer Execution:
The writer locks rw_mutex before writing (ensuring exclusive access).
It updates the shared data.
Once finished, it unlocks rw_mutex.

4. Fairness:
Readers have priority since multiple readers can read simultaneously while a writer must wait.
A writer can only proceed when no readers are reading.
This solution ensures mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting while allowing multiple readers to access the shared resource simultaneously.
