/*
Program Flow
============
1. Main thread starts.
2. Creates 5 threads that perform computations in parallel.
3. Each thread prints its ID and starts computation.
4. Main thread waits for all threads to finish.
5. Threads complete, print their results, and return their ID.
6. Main thread prints completion message and exits.
